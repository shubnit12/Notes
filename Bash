. Basic Syntax and Commands:
Shebang (#!): Always start your Bash scripts with a shebang line (#!/bin/bash) to specify the script interpreter.
Comments: Use # to add comments in your scripts for better readability.
2. Variables:
Defining and Using Variables: Use variable_name=value syntax. Access variables with $variable_name.
Exporting Variables: Use export variable_name to make the variable available to child processes.
3. Control Structures:
Conditional Statements: Use if, else, elif, and case for branching logic.
Loops: Use for, while, and until loops to iterate over elements or until a condition is met.
4. Functions:
Defining Functions: Create reusable blocks of code using:
function_name() {
    # code here
}
Calling Functions: Simply use the function name to call it.
5. Input and Output:
Reading User Input: Use read to take input from users.
Echoing Output: Use echo to display output to the terminal.
6. File Manipulation:
Reading from Files: Use redirection (<, >).
File Tests: Understand [ -f file ], [ -d dir ] to test for files or directories.
Using cat, grep, awk, and sed: Familiarize yourself with these commands for text processing.
7. Error Handling:
Exit Status: Check $? for the exit status of the last command.
Using set -e: To stop script execution on encountering an error.
8. Script Execution:
Making Scripts Executable: Use chmod +x script.sh to grant execute permission.
Running Scripts: Execute scripts using ./script.sh or bash script.sh.
9. Working with Arrays:
Declaring Arrays: Use array_name=(value1 value2 value3).
Accessing Elements: Use ${array_name[index]} to access specific elements.
10. Common Command-Line Utilities:
Using find, xargs, sort, uniq, etc.: These utilities often enhance Bash script capabilities for file and text management.
Practical Tips:
Practice Regularly: Create small scripts to automate repetitive tasks.
Explore Online Resources: Websites like Bash Academy and the Linux Documentation Project can be helpful.
Learn from Examples: Look at existing Bash scripts to understand how theyâ€™re structured.
