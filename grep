Basic Syntax
The basic command structure is:
grep [options] pattern [file...]
Example: Search for "hello" in file.txt:
grep "hello" file.txt
2. Common Options
-i: Ignore case distinctions:
grep -i "hello" file.txt
-v: Invert match; show lines that do not match the pattern:
grep -v "hello" file.txt
-r or -R: Recursive search through directories:
grep -r "hello" /path/to/dir
-n: Show line numbers of matching lines:
grep -n "hello" file.txt
-c: Count the number of matching lines:
grep -c "hello" file.txt
-l: List files with matching lines instead of the lines themselves:
grep -l "hello" *.txt
-w: Match whole words only:
grep -w "word" file.txt
3. Using Regular Expressions
Basic regex patterns can be used:
.: matches any single character.
*: matches zero or more of the preceding element.
^: anchors the match to the start of a line.
$: anchors the match to the end of a line.
Example: Match lines starting with "start":
grep "^start" file.txt
4. Using Pipes and Redirects
grep can be combined with other commands through piping:
ls -l | grep "txt"
Redirecting with file input:
cat file.txt | grep "hello"
5. Highlighting Matches
Use the --color option to highlight matching text in the output:
grep --color "hello" file.txt
6. Searching within Multiple Files
To search within multiple files:
grep "hello" file1.txt file2.txt
Use wildcards:
grep "hello" *.txt
7. Combining Options
You can combine options for more specific searches:
grep -i -n "hello" file.txt
8. Save to File
You can redirect the output of grep to a file:
grep "hello" file.txt > output.txt
9. Checking for Patterns
Use -q for quiet mode (not producing output) to check for the existence of a pattern:
grep -q "hello" file.txt && echo "Found" || echo "Not Found"
