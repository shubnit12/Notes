1. Basic SQL Syntax
Keywords: Key SQL commands for basic operations.
Detailed Example:
SELECT * FROM Employees;
This query selects all columns (*) from the Employees table.
2. Data Retrieval
SELECT Statement: Fetching data from a database.

Detailed Example:

SELECT name, age FROM Employees;
This retrieves only the name and age columns of all records in the Employees table.

WHERE Clause: Filtering data based on specific criteria.

Detailed Example:

SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE age > 30;
Here, you will get all records of employees aged over 30.

ORDER BY: Sorting the result set by specified column(s).

Detailed Example:

SELECT * FROM Employees ORDER BY name ASC;
This sorts the result by the name column in ascending order.

3. Filtering and Conditions
Using Operators: Using conditions to filter results.

Detailed Example:

SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE salary >= 50000 AND age < 40;
This retrieves all employees who earn at least 50,000 and are younger than 40.

Logical Operators: Using AND, OR, and NOT.

Detailed Example:

SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE NOT department = 'HR';
This gets all employees excluding those who work in the HR department.

4. Aggregate Functions
Using COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX:

Detailed Example with COUNT:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employees;
This returns the total number of employees.

Detailed Example with SUM:

SELECT SUM(salary) FROM Employees;
This calculates the total salary of all employees.

Average Salary:

SELECT AVG(salary) AS AverageSalary FROM Employees;
This shows the average salary of all employees.

5. Grouping Data
GROUP BY: Aggregating results across specified columns.

Detailed Example:

SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS NumEmployees FROM Employees GROUP BY department;
This groups employees by department and counts how many employees exist in each one.

Using HAVING: Filtering grouped results.

Detailed Example:

SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS AvgSalary 
FROM Employees GROUP BY department 
HAVING AVG(salary) > 60000;
This gets departments where the average salary exceeds 60,000, displaying only those departments.

6. Joins
INNER JOIN: Combining rows from two tables.

Detailed Example:

SELECT Employees.name, Departments.name 
FROM Employees 
INNER JOIN Departments ON Employees.department_id = Departments.id;
This retrieves names of employees along with their respective department names based on matching department_id.

LEFT JOIN: Getting all records from the left table and matching records from the right.

Detailed Example:

SELECT Employees.name, Departments.name 
FROM Employees 
LEFT JOIN Departments ON Employees.department_id = Departments.id;
This retrieves all employees, including those who may not be assigned to any department (resulting in NULL for the department name).

7. Subqueries
A query nested within another query.
Detailed Example:
SELECT name FROM Employees 
WHERE department_id IN (SELECT id FROM Departments WHERE location = 'New York');
This retrieves names of employees who work in departments located in New York by first identifying relevant department IDs.
8. Data Manipulation
INSERT: Adding new records to a table.

Detailed Example:

INSERT INTO Employees (name, age, salary, department_id) 
VALUES ('John Doe', 30, 55000, 2);
This adds a new employee named John Doe who is 30 years old, earns 55,000, and belongs to department 2.

UPDATE: Modifying existing records.

Detailed Example:

UPDATE Employees 
SET salary = 60000 
WHERE name = 'John Doe';
This updates the salary for John Doe to 60,000.

DELETE: Removing records from a table.

Detailed Example:

DELETE FROM Employees WHERE name = 'John Doe';
This deletes the entry for John Doe from the Employees table.

9. Creating and Modifying Tables
CREATE TABLE: Defining a new table structure.

Detailed Example:

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT,
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    department_id INT,
    hire_date DATE
);
This command creates a new Employees table with various columns.

ALTER TABLE: Change the structure of an existing table.

Detailed Example:

ALTER TABLE Employees ADD email VARCHAR(255);
This command adds a new email column to the Employees table.

DROP TABLE: Completely removing a table and its data.

Detailed Example:

DROP TABLE Employees;
10. Indexes
Creating an Index: Speeding up data retrieval.
Detailed Example:
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_name ON Employees (name);
This creates an index on the name column to allow for faster queries involving names.
11. Normalization and Database Design
Normalization: Applying rules to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
Detailed Example:
Tables Before Normalization:
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT,
    department VARCHAR(50)
);
Tables After Normalization:
Employees Table:
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT,
    department_id INT
);
Departments Table:
CREATE TABLE Departments (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50)
);
This design separates employee and department details to reduce redundancy.
12. Basic Error Handling
Common SQL Errors: Recognizing and understanding standard errors to troubleshoot.

Example:

SELECT name FROM Employees; -- This will work only if the Employees table exists
If the Employees table does not exist, you might receive an error stating "Table 'Employees' does not exist."

Another Example:
SELECT * FROM NonExistentTable;
You will get an error indicating that NonExistentTable cannot be found.
